## These functions return the inverse of a matrix that is supplied by the user, but only if the inverse
## of the matrix is not already in the cache. Working with a cache is meant to make obtaining
## the inverse of a matrix more efficient.

## Creates a special kind of matrix object that can cache its inverse.
